	<hr />
            <p><b>Have you considered donating?</b></p>
            <p>You are probaly aware that SME server is developed and supported by a collaborative community of volunteers from all over the world.
	 While SME server is free to download and use, maintaining the infrastructure behind the project (eg. hosting the forums and wiki, providing repositories and build servers etc.)
            costs real money in the real world.
	<p><b> In very much the same way you need us to address your current issue, we need YOUR help to keep this project alive!</b></p>
            <p>Please consider donating to the project by clicking on the image link below:</p>
